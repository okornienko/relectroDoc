# ElectroProject

So far, the objects presented (e.g. RecSession, SpikeTrain, CellGroup, Positrack, etc.) operate on a single recording session.
However, projects usually contain several recording sessions.
The ElectroProject class represents you project.
It contains a list of the RecSession objects that makes up your project.
The main purpose of the ElectroProject is to allow you to 1) run analysis of all your recording sessions and 2) merge the results from multiple recording sessions.

## Create an ElectroProject object

You can create an `ElectroProject` object with the `new()` function.
You need to specify a directory for your project.
This is a directory containing a folder for each of your animal.
Within the folders for the animals, you have folders for individual recording sessions.

After creating the ElectroProject object, you can create the list of RecSession objects with `setSessionList()`. 
The print method of the ElectroProject class gives you a summary of the recording sessions.
This is a good way to keep track of whether all recording sessions have been clustered.

```{r EP_create}
library(relectro)

ep<-new("ElectroProject",directory="~/Downloads/data_relectro_doc/linear_track")
ep<-setSessionList(ep)
print(ep)
```

Running `setSessionList()` might take a long time because it has to list all subdirectories of within the project directories. 
You might want to avoid running this each time you start a new R session. 
You can do this by saving your `ep` object to the disk and loading it as it was saved. 

```{R epSave}
# save to a file called ep
save(ep,file=paste(ep@resultsDirectory,"ep",sep="/")) 
# load the file called ep
load(file=paste(ep@resultsDirectory,"ep",sep="/"))
```

This way, you create and save the ep object only once, then you comment this part of the code out. 
The next session you only run the `load()` function.

## Problem with parameter files of recording sessions

One possible problem when using `setSessionList()` on a new database is that there are many directories that have faulty parameter files.
This might cause the function `setSessionList()` to return with an error message after a long waiting time.
If you find yourself in this situation, you might want to try to call `ep<-setSessionList(ep,loadSessions = F)`.
This will get the name and path of recording session without loading them.
Then run `ep<-loadSessionsInList(ep)`.
With this function, the waiting time is shorter before getting the error messages.
You can solve the problems with the faulty parameter files quickly.

## Methods
List the methods of the ElectroProject class
```{R EPMethods}
methods(class=ElectroProject)
```

## Session List

To run some analysis on several recording sessions, you need a list of RecSession objects.
You can get this from your ElectroProject object with the function `getSessionList`
You can select recording sessions based on brain areas, recording environments or on whether they were clustered or not.

```{R epSessionList}
rss<-getSessionList(ep,clustered=T,region="mec",environment="lt")
rss<-sortRecSessionListChronologically(rss)
print(paste("Number of recording sessions",length(rss)))
rs<-rss[[11]] ## example of single session to play with
print(rs)
```

Every RecSession object in the list contains all the parameters of this recording session.

### Visualize your RecSession list

Before starting the analysis on a group of recording sessions, you should first ensure that the recording protocol used in each recording session is what you expect. Use the `RecSessionListTrialPlot` function.

```{R epSessionListPlot}
recSessionListTrialPlot(rss)
```

In this case you can see that the recording sessions contain between `r min(sapply(rss,function(rs){sum(rs@environment=='lt')}))` and `r max(sapply(rss,function(rs){sum(rs@environment=='lt')}))` trials with the linear track (lt).

## Analysis of several recording sessions

There are two steps in the process of running code on several recording sessions.
First, you write a function that will be applied to all recording sessions.
Second, you apply this function to all your sessions.

### Functions for single RecSession objects

The first step is to write a function that will run on a single recording session. 
This is really similar to what we did in previous chapters, the only difference is that we put the code into a function.
We start with a simple example in which we just want to get the number of recorded neuron in each recording session.


To write this function, it is often useful to test it on a single recording session. 
This is why we got one out of our list with `rs<-rss[[11]]`.
We will get the number of neurons from the `nCells` slot of the SpikeTrain object.


```{R epFunction}
st<-new("SpikeTrain",session=rs@session,path=rs@path)
st<-loadSpikeTrain(st) # load res clu and sampling rate
st@nCells
```

Now we just transform this code into a function called `nCellsSession`.

```{R epFunction2}
nCellsSession<-function(rs){
  st<-new("SpikeTrain",session=rs@session,path=rs@path)
  st<-loadSpikeTrain(st) # load res clu and sampling rate
  return(list(nCells=st@nCells))
}
```

The code is very similar. 
An important point is to return the results as part of a list.
You can test the function like this.

```{R epFunction3}
nCellsSession(rs)
```

You can return several results from the same function. 
For example, we will now return the number of cells and the number of tetrodes.

```{R epFunction4}
nCellsSession<-function(rs){
  st<-new("SpikeTrain",session=rs@session,path=rs@path)
  st<-loadSpikeTrain(st) # load res clu and sampling rate
  return(list(nCells=st@nCells,nTetrode=rs@nElectrodes))
}
nCellsSession(rs)
```

You can also return much more data. 
For example, you can analyze several spatial properties of neurons and return their firing rate maps.
In this case, we return an array and a data.frame.

```{R epFunction5, cache=TRUE}

spatialScores<-function(rs){
 ## load the data in R
  myList<-getRecSessionObjects(rs)
  st<-myList$st
  pt<-myList$pt
  cg<-myList$cg
  sp<-myList$sp
  hd<-myList$hd

    ## get the position data for sqr70 
  ptsqr70<-setInvalidOutsideInterval(pt,s=getIntervalsEnvironment(rs,environment="sqr70"))
  ## only keep data when the animal had a speed between 3 and 100 cm/sec
  ptsqr70<-speedFilter(ptsqr70,minSpeed=3,maxSpeed = 100)
  ## spatial properties during the sqr70 in order to identify the neurons
  sp<-getMapStats(sp,st,ptsqr70) ## get info score, sparsity, border, grid score, etc.
  ## head direction selectivity for open field, histo, vector length and shuffled ##
  hd<-headDirectionStats(hd,st,ptsqr70)
  ## get speed scores
  st<-ifr(st)
  sp<-speedScore(sp,st,ptsqr70,minSpeed=3,maxSpeed=100,runLm=F)
  ## get mean firing rate of the neurons
  st<-meanFiringRate(st)
  ## create a data frame containing the data for each cell ##
  cells<-data.frame(mouse=rs@animalName,session=rs@session,cell.id=cg@id,tetrode.id=cg@tetrodeId,region=cg@brainRegion,
             clu.to.tet=cg@cluToTetrode,
             mean.rate=st@meanFiringRate, 
             info.score=sp@infoScore, border.score=sp@borderScore, grid.score=sp@gridScore,speed.score=sp@speedScore,
             hd.vl=hd@vectorLength,hd.peak.rate=hd@peakRates)
  ## create the spatial firing rate maps with a known size
  sp<-firingRateMap2d(sp,st,ptsqr70,nRowMap = 40,nColMap = 40)
  
  ## return all firing rate maps and the data.frame with the score. 
  return(list(sqr70.maps=sp@maps,
       cells=cells))
}
res<-spatialScores(rs)
print(res$cells)
```

### Run on sessions

In R, there is a function that is called `lapply`. 
This function apply a function of your choice to each item of a list.
For example, the code below create a list with the session name of all recording sessions.
```{R epLapply}
myFunction<-function(rs){rs@session}
myList<-lapply(rss,myFunction)
myList[[1]]
```

You could use `lapply` to run your analysis on your recording session but I recommand using `runOnSessions` instead. This method internally uses `lapply` but merges the results of the recording sessions together.
Below we will apply it to the first 5 sessions, as a test.

```{R epRun1, cache = TRUE}
runOnSessionList(ep,
                 sessionList=head(rss,n=5),
                 fnct=spatialScores,
                 save=T,overwrite=T)
```

### Collect results

Notice that the results were saved in two files.
The files are in a `results` directory located in the path of the ElectroProject object.
The file names are the names of the elements in the list returned by the function.
Here is how to load these files.

```{R epLoad1}
load(paste(ep@resultsDirectory,"cells",sep="/"))
print(paste("Number of cells:",length(cells$mean.rate)))
print(cells$mean.rate)
```

You now have access to the data of several recording sessions in the same data.frame.
You could also plot all firing rate maps.

```{R epMap1,fig.width=6,fig.height = 8}
load(paste(ep@directory,"results","sqr70.maps",sep="/"))
firingRateMapsPlot(sqr70.maps[,,1:30],names=cells$cell.id[1:30])
```

## Parallel processing

When the analysis performed on each recording session requires high processor usage, you can speed up the analysis by running the code on different computer threads.
You can use the `snow` package to do this.
If it is not install on your computer, try `install.packages("snow")`
All you need to do is to create a cluster of threads, and then call `runOnSessions()` with the right arguments.


```{R epPara, cache =TRUE}
library(snow)
workers<-c(rep("localhost",5))
cl<-makeCluster(workers, type = "SOCK",outfile="")
print(paste("Using",length(workers), "threads"))
## load the relectro package on each thread
clusterEvalQ(cl,library(relectro))
runOnSessionList(ep,sessionList=head(rss,n=5),
                 fnct=spatialScores,
                 save=T,overwrite=T,
                 parallel=T,cluster=cl) # tell the function to work in parallel
stopCluster(cl) # stop the cluster when we are done
rm(cl,workers)
```

In this case all the threads were on the same computer.
You can use different computers by adding their ip addresses in the `workers` vector.
All computers needs to run the same version of R and `relectro`.
You mainly gain time when analysis requires heavy CPU usage (e.g. if you calculate instantaneous firing rate or do some shuffling analysis).
