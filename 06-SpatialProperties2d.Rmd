# SpatialProperties2d

This chapter documents the use of the SpatialProperties2d class of the relectro package. 
SpatialProperties2d objects are used to make firing rate maps. 
They can give you the statistics associated with the maps. 
You can also get the spatial autocorrelation of the maps.

## Create a SpatialProperties2d object

SpatialProperties2d objects are used together with RecSession, SpikeTrain and Positrack objects.
We create these 4 objects.

```{r sp2d_create}
library(relectro)
## assign the name of the session to a variable called session
session="jp4298-18022016-0106"
datadir="~/Downloads/data_relectro_doc/linear_track/jp4298/jp4298-18022016-0106"
# create a RecSession object
rs<-new("RecSession",session=session,path=datadir)
rs<-loadRecSession(rs)
# create Positrack object and load data
pt<-new("Positrack",session=session,path=datadir)
pt<-loadPositrack(pt)
# create SpikeTrain object and load data
st<-new("SpikeTrain",session=rs@session,path=rs@path)
st<-loadSpikeTrain(st) # load res clu and sampling rate
# create a SpatialProerties2d object
sp<-new("SpatialProperties2d")
```

## Get all RecSession objects
When doing analysis, it is often the case that you need to use several *relectro* objects.
To simplify the process, you can call a single function that returns a list with all *relectro* objects associated with a recording session.

```{R sp2d_create2}
# create a RecSession object
rs<-new("RecSession",session=session,path=datadir)
rs<-loadRecSession(rs)
# get all other relectro objects
myList<-getRecSessionObjects(rs)
pt<-myList$pt
st<-myList$st
sp<-myList$sp
```

This makes the code more compact.

## Methods
List the methods of the SpatialProperties2d class
```{R SpatialProperties2dMethods}
methods(class=SpatialProperties2d)
```

We will not cover all methods. If you are curious, remember that you can get the documentation of the methods with `?`, as in `?getMapStats`.

## Firing rate maps

Firing rate maps are used to visualize the firing rate of a neuron in a 2D environment. Making the firing rate maps is relatively easy. You set the time interval in the SpikeTrain object to limit the analysis to some time period and then make the maps. 
```{R sp2d_maps}
st.sqr70<-setIntervals(st,
                    getIntervalsEnvironment(rs,environment = "sqr70"))
sp<-firingRateMap2d(sp,st.sqr70,pt)
print(sp)
```

By default, the bins in the map are 2x2 cm or 4 cm$^2$. The standard deviation of the smoothing kernels is 3 cm. These settings should work for most experiments. These variable could be changed by modifying the attributes of the SpatialProperties2d objects: `smoothOccupancySd`,`smoothRateMapSd` and `cmPerBin`

The data of the firing rate maps are stored in the `maps` attributes and the occupancy map in in the attribute `occupancy`.

## Speed filter

It is common to remove periods of near immobility from the firing rate maps. You can do this with the `speedFilter` method of the Postrackt object.
```{R sp2d_maps_speed}
pt.sf<-speedFilter(pt,minSpeed = 3,maxSpeed = 100)
sp<-firingRateMap2d(sp,st.sqr70,pt.sf)
```

## Plot firing rate maps

The maps are saved in an array called `maps`. You probably want to have a look at the map now.
There are two functions in *relectro* to do this: `firingRateMapPlot()` and `firingRateMapsPlot()`
```{R, sp2d_maps1, fig.width=2.5, fig.height=2.5}
firingRateMapPlot(sp@maps[,,1])
```
```{R sp2d_maps2, fig.width=6,fig.height = 5}
firingRateMapsPlot(sp@maps,names=st@cellList,
                   ncol = 4,nrow = 3)
```

## Map statistics

There are several variables that describe the firing patterns in the firing rate maps: 

```{R sp2d_stats,results="hide"}
sp<-getMapStats(sp,st.sqr70,pt.sf)
## if you are curious to see the function code, use getMethod()
getMethod("getMapStats","SpatialProperties2d")
```

With the getMapStats, you get the peak firing rate, information score, sparsity score, border score, grid score and grid spacing of each map. They are stored in the attributes of the SpatialProperties2d object.

You can easily access the results with the `@`.

```{R sp2d_stats1}
print(sp@peakRate)
print(sp@infoScore)
print(sp@gridScore)
```


## Shuffling procedure to get chance levels

To get the chance levels for these scores, a shuffling procedure is often used. 
The procedure consists of recalculating the statistics several time (e.g. 100 times). 
For each of these calculations, the position data are shifted randomly in time. 
Thus, the relationship between the spike and the position of the animals is changed.
After all calculations, we get a distribution of statistics when the position of the spike is random.
This can be used to get a significance threshold. 

```{R sp2dShuffle,cache=TRUE}
sp@nShufflings<-100 # would normally be at least 500
sp<-getMapStatsShuffle(sp,st.sqr70,pt.sf)
hist(sp@infoScoreShuffle,xlim=c(0,1)) # show the distribution
statThreshold<-quantile(sp@infoScoreShuffle,probs = 0.95) # get threshold
print(paste("The 0.95 quantile is",statThreshold))
print("cells with significant infromation score:")
print(st.sqr70@cellList[sp@infoScore>statThreshold])
```

The function takes a few seconds as it needs to calculate `r length(sp@infoScore)*sp@nShufflings` firing rate maps and spatial autocorrelations.


## Speed score

There has been a recent interest in the relationship between running speed and the firing rate of neurons.
You can test for such relationship as shown below.

```{R speedCode, cache=TRUE}
st<-ifr(st) ## get the ifr for the entire recording session
st1<-setIntervals(st,s=getIntervalsEnvironment(rs,environment = "sqr70")[1,1],e=getIntervalsEnvironment(rs,environment = "sqr70")[1,2]) # set some intervals
sp<-speedScore(sp,st1,pt,minSpeed=3,maxSpeed=100,runLm=T) # get speed scores using ifr within intervals
print(sp@speedScore)
```

You can also plot the firing rate of a cell as a function of running speed.

```{R speedTuningCurve}
srl<-speedRateTuningCurve(sp,st1,pt,minSpeed=3,maxSpeed=100)
print(head(srl))
plot(srl$mid[which(srl$clu==7)],srl$rate[which(srl$clu==7)],type='l',xlab="Running speed (cm/sec)",ylab="Firing rate (Hz)")
```

## Map stability

Map stability is just a correlation coeficient between the friring rate values of 2 firing rate maps.
You get this score by creating firing rate maps in two separate SpatialProperties2d objects. 
Then you call the method `firingRateMapCorrelation(sp1,sp2)` to get the map stability scores.
Here is an example that would work for a project in which the recording sessions have at least 2 trials in the `sqr70` environment.
```{R sp2d_stability,cache=TRUE,eval=FALSE}
  ## Set intervals at first sqr70
  st1<-setIntervals(st,s=getIntervalsEnvironment(rs,environment = "sqr70")[1,1],e=getIntervalsEnvironment(rs,environment = "sqr70")[1,2])
  ## Set intervals at second sqr70
  st2<-setIntervals(st,s=getIntervalsEnvironment(rs,environment = "sqr70")[2,1],e=getIntervalsEnvironment(rs,environment = "sqr70")[2,2])
  ## Prepare the positrack object
  pt<-speedFilter(pt,minSpeed = 3,maxSpeed = 100)
  ## Get 2 SpatialProperties2d objects with maps of the first and second trials
  ## Make sure that the maps are construct with the same Positrack object
  sp1<-firingRateMap2d(sp,st1,pt)
  sp2<-firingRateMap2d(sp,st2,pt)
  ## Get the map stability
  mapCorr<-firingRateMapCorrelation(sp1,sp2)
```

## Spatial autocorrelations

You probably noticed that the neuron with the cluster id `8` looks like a grid cell.
To highlight the 60 degree regularity in the map, we usually use spatial autocorrelations.
You need to calculate the firing rate maps and then get the spatial autocorrelations

```{R sp2d_autocorrelation}
sp<-firingRateMap2d(sp,st.sqr70,pt.sf)
sp<-mapSpatialAutocorrelation(sp)
firingRateMapAutoPlot(sp@autos[,,which(st@cellList==8)])
```

There is also the function `firingRateMapAutosPlot()` to plot all spatial autocorrelation.

## Spikes on path

It is a good idea to inspect the raw position data to identify potential problems. 
In the case of spatially selective neurons, this means to look at the path of the animal together with the spikes. Use the function `spikeOnPath` to get the path and spike positions. Only data that fall withing the intervals set in the SpikeTrain object will be used. `spikeOnPathPlot` generate the plot for a single neuron.

```{R sp2d_spikesOnPath}
sop<-spikeOnPath(sp,st.sqr70,pt)
spikeOnPathPlot(sop,clu=8)

```

## Spatial crosscorrelation

If you want to know the relationship between the firing fields in two separate firing rate maps, calculate the spatial crosscorrelation of the maps.
This is used to see the phase difference between two grid cells.
```{R sp2d_spatial_crosscorrelation}
st.sqr70<-setCellList(st.sqr70,c(8,10))
sp<-firingRateMap2d(sp,st.sqr70,pt.sf)
sp<-mapSpatialCrosscorrelation(sp)
firingRateMapCrossPlot(sp@ccMaps[,,1])
rm(session,datadir,rs,pt,st,st.sqr70,sp,pt2,sop,statThreshold)
```
